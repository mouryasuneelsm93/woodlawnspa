			<tr><td><h2>Exotic dance moves</h2></td></tr>
			<tr><td><p>Yes, you are right as part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows,with definitions:</p></td></tr>
			<tr><td><dl>Polynesian Chicken dance
				<dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle chickens, in encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q>.</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>Icelandic brownian shuffle
				<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which involved huddlin close together in a circle on the floar, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to sy that he thought this dance inspired modern style suck as Twerking.</dd></dl>
			<dl>Arctic robot dance
				<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterstics by <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitantsof Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was dicovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd></dl>
